# Executive Summary
This comprehensive final report encapsulates the successful culmination of a Boston
University Capstone Project aimed at developing a Conversational Large Language Model
(LLM) for deFacto Global Inc, an industry-leading SaaS company headquartered in Troy, New
York, renowned for its Extended Financial Planning & Analysis (xP&A) software3. The primary
objective of this project is to harness the power of machine learning to enhance the operational
efficiency of client-facing consultants by providing an innovative LLM solution. The proposed
LLM leverages natural language processing techniques to automate the delivery and
comprehension of training materials, thereby alleviating consultants from repetitive tasks, and
empowering them to focus on value-added engagements. In collaboration with data scientists at
deFacto Global, this project marks a significant stride towards transforming operational
paradigms and ensuring a strategic edge in the realm of business modeling and planning.
The goal of this report is to provide a solution into the company's request and its
objectives in optimizing its operations. We explore the approach that led to the successful
extraction of complete text data from their official website. Furthermore, we delve into the
findings obtained from an analysis of the explanatory text data. The report then documents our
comprehensive research on three distinct models, detailing the rationale behind each exploration,
along with the rationale for ultimately selecting Pinecone Model as our final choice.
Additionally, this report aims to offer clear instructions for both technical and non-technical staff
to seamlessly access and effectively utilize our developed model to enhance their business
operations. Furthermore, we provide suggestions for future implications, including the
deployment of the model on Google Cloud Platform and the creation of a user interface on
WordPress, if needed in the future. By engaging in real-world usage of popular language models,
this project serves as a catalyst for fostering discussions on leveraging machine learning to
strategically position operations amidst competitors, ultimately enhancing stakeholder value.
